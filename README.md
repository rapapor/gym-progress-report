## Project Description
Gym Progress Report is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** and trainer dashboard that streamlines the workflow of collecting progress data.

- **Styling**: Tailwind 4, Shadcn/ui
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter.ai for LLM access
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, MSW
- **CI/CD & Hosting**: GitHub Actions, Docker image on DigitalOcean
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged
