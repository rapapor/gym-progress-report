## Backend and database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions
- follow supabase guidlines for security and performance
- use zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend
- use supabase from context.locals in astro routes instead of importing supabaseclient directly
- use supabaseClient type from 'src/db/supabase.client.ts', not from @supabase/supabase-js'
